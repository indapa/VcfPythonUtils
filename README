VcfPythonUtils contains utilities to work with Variant Call Format (VCF) files. 
It consists of a set of python classes and programs based off those classes to analyze and manipulate VCF files.

I'm working on proper documentation to describe the analysis programs and python classes used to represent a VCF. 
If you have any questions, please email me.
