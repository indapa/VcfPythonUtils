VcfPythonUtils contains utilities to work with Variant Call Format (VCF) files. 

vcfIO.py contains python functions that read VCF files.

vcfToBeagle.py convert VCF to beagle_3.3 input format

vcfCallRate.py - given a VCF file the file snpcallrate.txt and samplecallrate.txt give the callrates for individuals and markers in a VCF file

vcfUnion.py - using the bx-python bitset api, take the union of any number of VCF files and print bed file of coordinates to STDOUT

comparePhasedVcf.py - compare genotypes for phased and unphased versions of the same VCF file

compareVcfGenotypes.py - compare the genotypes in second VCF  file to the ones in the first VCF  file
The two VCFs should have the same sites but not necessarily the same samples
