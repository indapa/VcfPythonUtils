VcfPythonUtils contains utilities to work with Variant Call Format (VCF) files. 

I am starting  a complete re-write of VcfPythonUtils using an object oriented approach.
I don't really consider myself a programmer, but I think using an OO approach the
API will be simplier to use and modify as the specfiications for VCF files evolve. 


The file VcfFile.py defines a VcfFile object with container objects of 
MetaLines and HeaderLines which represent the meta info for the file and the header
line for the VCF file. Datalines in a VCF file are represented with a VcfRecord object
and genotype fields of a VCF file are represented by VcfGenotype object.

For analysis operations like intersecting with other VCF or bed files, calculating Hardy-Weinberg
equlibrium, annotating a VCF file by adding the INFO string will be done by calling methods
on the VcfFile object. I think this makes for a much cleaner API and makes things like annotating
a VCF file much easier. I was pretty much ignoring meta info in the (the ## lines in a VCF)
which made writing results of some analyses in VCF format very difficult. 

I think this re-factoring of VcfPythonUtils will make it better and make biological analysis based off
of VCF files easier.
