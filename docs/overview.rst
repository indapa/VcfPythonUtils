VcfPythonUtils is a set of Python scripts and classes to read, manipulate, and analyse `VCF <http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/Analysis/Variant%20Call%20Format/vcf-variant-call-format-version-41>`_ files. VCF stands for Variant Call Format is a text format used to store  genotype information on a set of samples that were sequenced. Header lines contain meta-information about the sequencing experiment
and methods to call variants. Datalines contain sample ids, genotypes, and other meta info about the variant call. 

I'm slowly adding documentation of the list of programs I'm written to manipulate and analyze VCF files in my `VcfPythonUtils <https://github.com/indapa/VcfPythonUtils>`_ github repo.
